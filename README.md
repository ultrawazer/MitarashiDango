### 📱 Android Installation (Termux)

You can run **dango** on your Android device using the [Termux](https://termux.dev/) app. No root is required.

1. **Install Termux:** Download and install it from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) or the [Termux website](https://termux.dev/).
2. **Update packages:**
   ```bash
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   ```
   _Press `y` and `Enter` when prompted to confirm updates._
3. **Install Node.js:**
   ```bash
   pkg install nodejs
   ```
   _Press `y` and `Enter` when prompted._
4. **Install dango:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @serifpersia/dango
   ```
5. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   dango
   ```

Once running, you can access the interface by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/` in your mobile browser.

### Android APK (No Termux Required)

A standalone Android app that bundles Node.js + dango with a WebView UI.

1. **Download** the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/serifpersia/dango/releases) or build it yourself.
2. **Install** the APK on your Android device (enable "Install from unknown sources" if prompted).

Features:

- Auto-installs everything on first launch
- Checks for dango updates on each launch

**Build from source:**

```bash
cd android-app
python fetch-termux-node.py

# Windows:
build-debug.bat
# Linux/macOS:
chmod +x build-debug.sh && ./build-debug.sh
```

Requires: Python 3, Java 17+, Android SDK (build-tools 36.0.0, platform android-36).

---

## Uninstalling

If you need to remove the application from your system, simply open a terminal and run:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @serifpersia/dango
```

_This safely deletes the application files and removes the `dango` command from your system's PATH._

---

## Manual Installation (For Developers)

Want to poke around the source code or contribute? You can build the project manually.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serifpersia/dango.git
cd dango
```

**2. Install, Build, and Run:**
This project uses **npm workspaces** (`client` + `server`) with a single `package-lock.json` at the root. All dependencies are installed and hoisted together.

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (root + workspaces, deduped).
2. Run `npm run build` to build both workspaces (`client` via Vite, `server` via `tsc`).

Use the provided run scripts that offer a menu to choose between a **Development** or **Production** setup:

**On Linux / macOS:**

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

**On Windows:**

```bat
run.bat
```

### Commands

Once installed globally, you can use the following commands:

- `dango` - Start the application.
- `dango --version` (or `-v`) - Check your installed version.

**For developers (workspaces):**

- `npm install` - Install all workspaces (hoisted, single lockfile).
- `npm run build` - Build both `client` and `server` (`npm run build --workspaces`).
- `npm run dev` / `npm start` - Run via `orchestrator.js` (spawns `dango-server` + `dango-client` with `npm --workspace`).
- `npm run --workspace=dango-client dev` - Run only the frontend (Vite).
- `npm run --workspace=dango-server dev` - Run only the backend (`nodemon` + `ts-node`).
- `npm run lint --workspaces` - Lint both workspaces.

### Data Location

dango stores your persistent files in your OS app-data folder instead of inside the globally installed npm package:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\dango`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/dango`
- **Linux:** `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dango` or `~/.local/share/dango`

This folder contains your `.env`, database files, sync manifests, and Google token file. Existing installs will automatically migrate legacy files from the old `server/` folder on first launch when those files are still present.

---

## Cloud Sync (Optional)

**dango** can automatically sync your local data to the cloud. The app stays local-first: your
main database is a local SQLite file, and cloud sync exports/imports the app data as JSON when
needed.

Sync provider priority is:

1. **GitHub Cloud Sync**
2. **Google Drive Sync**
3. **Rclone Sync**

If GitHub is connected, it is used first. Google Drive and Rclone remain available as fallback or
legacy sync options.

### 2. Google Drive Sync

Google Drive sync is preconfigured with a default dango-managed Google client. No Google Cloud
project setup is required:

1. Open **dango**.
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Synchronization**.
3. Click **Sign in with Google** and approve access.

Your sync data is stored in a private Google Drive appdata folder in JSON format:

- Production mode uses `sync.json`.
- Development mode uses `sync.dev.json`.

To fully disconnect Google Drive sync and remove stored data, go to **Google Drive settings** → **Manage apps**, find **dango**, and revoke access. Then delete the hidden appdata sync files from your Drive.

If you prefer to use your own Google OAuth client, you can override the default in the Google
authentication advanced settings.

### 1. GitHub Cloud Sync

1. Open **dango**.
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Synchronization**.
3. Click **Sign in with GitHub**.
4. Open the shown GitHub device URL, enter the code, and approve access.

dango will create a private GitHub repository named `dango-sync-data` in your account and store
your sync data in JSON:

- Production mode uses `sync.json`.
- Development mode uses `sync.dev.json`.

The app requests GitHub repository access because it needs to create and update this private sync
repository. The GitHub token is stored locally in your dango app-data `.env` file.

To fully remove synced data, delete the `dango-sync-data` repository from your GitHub account.

### 3. Rclone Sync

If you prefer using **Mega**, **Dropbox**, or other providers, you can use [Rclone](https://rclone.org/):

1. Install Rclone on your system and ensure it's in your PATH.
2. Configure a remote using `rclone config`.
3. In **dango**, go to **Settings** -> **Synchronization** and select your remote name from the
   Rclone dropdown.

Rclone is used only when GitHub and Google Drive sync are not active.

---

## AniList Sync (Optional)

**dango** can sync your local watchlist with your AniList account. This is a bidirectional sync:
local progress (status, episode count) is pushed to AniList, and remote changes are pulled into
your local database.

### Syncing

Go to **Trackers** in the side menu and click **Sync Now**, or let dango sync automatically when
configured. The sync compares your local database against your AniList list and applies changes
non-destructively.
